The game takes place after the Fictional Zombie Infection Virus

The two ways to win are
1. Defend the D.O.G (Crashed Norad) for 1 Hour Real Time (90:00 Countdown Timer)
or
2. Destroy the Infected Overmind

Players start with some units, and must explore the city to gain material and supply
Gas -> Minerals
Refinery Adds 12 Supply Each
Infantry and SCVS produced from Barracks
Depots collect Resources (Like Command Center)

In order to build advanced Equipment (Vehicles and Aircraft) players must expand and secure Addons
In order to upgrade basic stats, secure a Covert Ops
In order to research technologies, secure a Physics Lab


Zombies Continually Spawn, but also send large hordes for a concentrated attack
Zombies evolve and grow stronger over time
There is a difficulty selector at the start. Difficulty affects frequency of spawns and speed of zombie evolution (stronger zombies)
