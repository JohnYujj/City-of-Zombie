The game takes place in a city of zombies

The two ways to win are
1. Defend the D.O.G (Crashed Norad) for 1 Hour Real Time (90:00 Countdown Timer)
or
2. Destroy the Infected Overmind

This is Starcraft-ish where you must gather resources and produce units
Players start with some units, and must explore the city to gain material, supply, technology

Gas -> Minerals
Refinery Adds 12 Supply Each
Infantry and SCVS produced from Barracks
Depots collect Resources (Like Command Center)
In order to build advanced Equipment (Vehicles and Aircraft) players must expand and secure Machine Shop and Control Tower
In order to upgrade basic stats, secure a Covert Ops
In order to research technologies, secure a Physics Lab


Zombies Continually Spawn, but also send large hordes for a concentrated attack
Zombies evolve and grow stronger over time
There is a difficulty selector at the start. Difficulty affects frequency of spawns and speed of zombie evolution (stronger zombies)

Mind Control to increase Difficulty (Counted by Gas), Feedback to Start Game
Recommended Difficulty:
Difficulty 0-2 = Practice/Sandbox
Difficulty 3-5 = Normal
Difficulty 6+ = Hard Challenge
There is no Limit to Difficulty (But I think it will become impossible to win by 10+)


Recommended Strategy:
-First things to build are 1 Barracks and 2 Refinery and 1 Bunker
  -In 4 Player, one person will have to expand for Refinery
-Block Entrances with Bunkers (They Completely Block the Road of Zombies)
-At least 1 player expands with units to secure more resources and technology
  -Sunkens are Weak, but be careful of elite zombies guarding

-After Defense set up, expand with Infantry and secure production
-Vulture Early Game to defend/expand on higher difficulties
-Tanks Early-Middle Game to destroy stronger defenses (Cannons) and Ultralisks
-Fighters Middle Game for Mutalisk and Guardian
  -Muta may decide to attack your economy, fighters can chase them through the city while Goliaths/Turrets get stuck

-Expand to middle of map for more resources and production and upgrades
-You will need a cominbation of Infantry + Tanks + Air to survive later stages
-Infantry player can use dropships in late game
